# Pygame Experiments

A simple repo to play with Pygame. Where code taken from the internet, attribution in sub-dir README's.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment for your Python code so it does not affect any other Python code on your machine:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

You must activate the virtual environment:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Test Pygame:

```sh
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```
